                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Background</p>
                    <p>My name is Brian Guo and I am currently a Software Engineer working for Capgemini. I did my undergrad at UNC-Chapel Hill, with a double major in Computer Science and Information Science. </p>
                    <p>I am born in Manhattan, New York on August 31st 2000. While I was born in New York, I did not live there long. When I was one, my parents took me to China, where I spend most of my childhood. My parents are from Fuzhou, a south eastern city in the country, which explains the inherit chinese culture in my family. That being said, english is not my second language and because of that, I still often trip up on sentences and find it difficult to convert my thoughts into words.</p>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Interests</p>
                    <p>Some of my favourite freetime activites include: hiking, cooking, gaming, walks, and spending time with friends</p>
                    <p>Music - was a part of high school band and marching band, played the bassoon and saxophone. I love to play musical instruments!</p>
                    <p>Art - something that I got into recently! Doodling and drawing is fun and relaxing. Whenever I am stressed, I would either draw or take a walk!</p>
